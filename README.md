## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Datejs](https://github.com/datejs/Datejs) JavaScript library used to calculate the dates.

### What I learned

The most valuable lesson I took from this challenge was not to make the website responsive only AFTER everything; instead, I'll be doing what I've done all along (until this challenge) and work on all the views as I code the frontend.

I've also learned I have a long way to go with JavaScript.

### Continued development

One thing I definitely need to work on is to link the [Datejs](https://github.com/datejs/Datejs) library directly instead of adding it to my script.js file.

### Useful resources

- [Datejs](https://github.com/datejs/Datejs) - Instead of spending a huge amount of time creating an algorithm to calculate time elapsed since any given date, I chose to use this library. Trust me, it's a lot faster and easier.

I've used a lot of [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com/) this project. Like I said before, I also used the library [Datejs](https://github.com/datejs/Datejs).
